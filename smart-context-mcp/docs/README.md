## 🎓 Key Concepts

**Scout → Read → Edit Pipeline**
The canonical 3-stage workflow for code analysis and modification:
1. **Scout** - Find relevant files/symbols using search and indexing
2. **Read** - Understand code structure with AST analysis and skeleton generation
3. **Edit** - Make modifications with transaction safety and crash recovery

**Token Efficiency**
Smart Context dramatically reduces token usage through:
- **Skeleton generation**: 95-98% token reduction (250 tokens vs 15,000+)
- **Fragment reading**: 90% reduction for specific sections
- **Context clustering**: Relevant files only, not entire project
- **Agent-specific optimization**: Tailor token usage to model context windows

**Reliability First**
Built-in safety mechanisms:
- **ACID transactions**: All-or-nothing modifications
- **Crash recovery**: Automatic rollback on failure
- **Confidence scoring**: 0.0-1.0 reliability indicators
- **Error enhancement**: Helpful recovery suggestions

**Performance**
Optimized for large codebases:
- **Cold indexing**: 45-60 seconds for 10K files
- **Search latency**: 5-20ms P50 for symbol lookups
- **Memory efficient**: ~400MB for 10K files
- **Scalable**: Handles enterprise-scale codebases

**Agent Optimization**
Smart Context works with different AI models:
- **Claude Opus**: Large context (200K), detailed analysis
- **Claude Sonnet**: Balanced (200K context), most versatile
- **Claude Haiku**: Fast (100K context), cost-optimized
- **GPT-4o**: High quality, requires explicit prompting
- **Gemini 2.0**: Massive context (1M), bulk operations
